            <h1>HIS BACKGROUND</h1>
            <div class="column">
<p>The Weeknd, whose real name is Abel Makkonen Tesfaye, is a Canadian singer, songwriter, 
    and record producer who has made a significant impact on the music industry since his debut 
    in the early 2010s. Born on February 16, 1990, in Toronto, Ontario, The Weeknd emerged from 
    relative obscurity to become one of the most influential and successful artists of his generation.</p>
    <p>His music is known for its dark, moody, and atmospheric sound, often blending elements of 
        R&B, pop, and electronic music. The Weeknd first gained recognition with his 2011 mixtapes, 
        including "House of Balloons," which were critically acclaimed and quickly earned him a 
        devoted fanbase. These early works showcased his distinctive voice, haunting lyrics, and 
        unique production style.</p>
         <p>The Weeknd's breakthrough came with his 2015 album "Beauty Behind 
            the Madness," which included hit singles like "Can't Feel My Face" and 
            "The Hills." This album not only topped charts worldwide but also earned him 
            multiple Grammy Awards. He continued his success with subsequent albums, including 
            "Starboy" (2016) and "After Hours" (2020), the latter featuring the record-breaking 
            single "Blinding Lights," which became one of the most streamed songs of all time.</p>
