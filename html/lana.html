            <div class="column">
<p>Lana Del Rey, born Elizabeth Woolridge Grant on June 21, 1985, in New York City, is an American 
    singer, songwriter, and record producer known for her distinctive voice and cinematic style. 
    She began her music career in the mid-2000s under her real name and released several projects 
    before adopting the stage name Lana Del Rey in 2011. Her breakthrough came with the release of the 
    single "Video Games," which garnered widespread attention for its nostalgic and melancholic tone, 
    setting the stage for her debut album, Born to Die (2012). The album was a commercial success, 
    featuring hit singles like "Summertime Sadness" and "Blue Jeans," and established her as a unique 
    voice in the pop music landscape.</p>
    <p>Lana Del Rey's music is characterized by its dreamy, cinematic quality, often incorporating 
        themes of romance, nostalgia, and melancholy. Her second album, Paradise (2012), which is an 
        extended play of Born to Die, continued this trend and was praised for its lush production and 
        emotive lyrics. This was followed by Ultraviolence (2014), an album that marked a shift towards 
        a darker and more introspective sound. The album, produced by Dan Auerbach of The Black Keys, 
        received critical acclaim and included the singles "West Coast" and "Shades of Cool." Lana Del 
        Rey’s exploration of new themes and sounds reflected her evolving artistry and deepened her 
        connection with her audience.</p>
         <p>In 2015, Lana Del Rey released Honeymoon, an album that continued her exploration of 
            melancholic and cinematic themes, with standout tracks such as "High by the Beach" and 
            "Music to Watch Boys To." The album's rich, orchestral arrangements and introspective 
            lyrics reinforced her reputation as a distinctive and influential artist. Her subsequent 
            album, Lust for Life (2017), featured collaborations with artists like The Weeknd and A$AP 
            Rocky and explored themes of love and personal freedom against a backdrop of social and 
            political commentary. The album's lead single, "Love," was particularly well-received 
            and showcased her ability to blend pop with a more hopeful, yet still nostalgic, tone.</p>
