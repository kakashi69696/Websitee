            <div class="column">
<p>Ariana Grande, born on June 26, 1993, in Boca Raton, Florida, is a prominent American singer, 
    songwriter, and actress known for her remarkable vocal talent and significant influence on 
    contemporary pop music. She began her career as a child actress, making her debut in the Broadway 
    musical 13 before gaining fame on Nickelodeon's Victorious (2010-2013) as Cat Valentine. 
    Her success on the show led to the spinoff series Sam & Cat (2013-2014), further establishing 
    her presence in the entertainment industry. However, Grande's true passion for music emerged as 
    she transitioned from acting to pursuing a career as a singer.</p>
    <p>In 2013, Ariana Grande released her debut album Yours Truly, which debuted at number one on the 
        Billboard 200 chart and featured the hit single "The Way." This initial success set the stage 
        for her subsequent albums, including My Everything (2014), which produced chart-topping singles 
        like "Problem" and "Break Free." Grande's unique blend of pop and R&B, combined with her 
        impressive vocal range, quickly garnered her acclaim and established her as a rising star in 
        the music industry. Her third album, Dangerous Woman (2016), marked a more mature phase in her 
        career, showcasing her versatility and solidifying her reputation as a leading pop artist.</p>
         <p>Ariana Grande's career faced a significant challenge in 2017 when a terrorist attack 
            occurred at her concert in Manchester, England, resulting in tragic loss of life. Despite
             this traumatic experience, Grande demonstrated resilience and strength by organizing 
             the "One Love Manchester" benefit concert to support the victims and their families. 
             This event, featuring numerous artists, became a symbol of unity and solidarity in the face 
             of adversity. Following this, Grande continued to achieve musical success with albums
             like Sweetener (2018) and Thank U, Next (2019), both of which were critically acclaimed 
             and commercially successful. Thank U, Next featured hits such as "Thank U, Next" and "7 
             Rings," highlighting her ability to turn personal experiences into powerful, relatable music.</p>
