                    Ariana Grande, known for her impressive vocal range, has dominated the pop and R&B 
                    charts with hits from albums like "Thank U, Next," while The Weeknd has redefined

                    dance-pop sound, especially with her hit album "Future Nostalgia," which has 
                    solidified her as a global pop icon.</p>
                    <p>Ed Sheeran continues to be one of the most successful singer-songwriters, known
